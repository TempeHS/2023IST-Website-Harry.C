<h2> What are Lychees </h2>

Lychees are a tropical fruit with a bright red bumpy exterior but a voluptous, sweet but also sour interior that oozes out juice on the first bite of the fruit. The word to describe lychees are aromatic with taste bordering on europhic. For non Lychee enthusiasts it's known as the forbidden fruit, I wouldn't try the almighty, succulent and orgasmic gift from above, as there's no going back.

<h2> Where do they come from </h2>

Lychees come from Southeast asia, they date back to over 2000 years ago. As in the Tang dynasty in China, the emporor tried the heaven sent crop. From then on the emporor began plantations south of China where they are now found in countries like Vietnam, China and the Phillipines. While ancient philisopher Confuscious says "Lychee are the rocks of Buddha himself."

<h2> Why do I like Lychees </h2>


<h6> Everyone remembers their first time trying the forbidden fruit, It was late at night, and I'd been on twitter all night, when suddenly my eye sight succumbed to a bright white light followed up by an overwhelmingly sweet fragrance when a trail of lychees appeared. I began devouring them and finding myself losing control of my cognitive abilities with all power being focused on devouring lychees until the path concluded at a refridgerated 5 kg bag of lychees. From that day onwards, every lychee season comes with 3kg of Lychees per week. That is why I like Lychees. </h6>
